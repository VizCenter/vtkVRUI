/**
 * @brief The vvGLObject class extends the VRUI GLObject abstraction.
 *
 * vvGLObject extends VRUI's GLObject system for separating and maintaining
 * application / context state. Each subclass should manage one or more related
 * props in the rendered scene.
 *
 * Do not implement GLObject::initContext -- it will not be called, as auto
 * initialization is disabled for these classes. Instead, put all initialization
 * code into initVvContext.
 *
 * The goal of this class is to simplify the integration of VTK rendering
 * concepts into the VRUI GLObject abstraction.
 *
 * The synchronization points are:
 *
 * initVvContext: Called from vvApplication::initContext(). Use this to do
 *                one-time setup of this object's context-specific state with
 *                respect to the application's vvContextState (e.g. add actors
 *                to the renderer). This replaces the GLObject::initContext
 *                method.
 *
 * syncApplicationState: Called from vvApplication::frame(). Update the
 *                       application-side data pipeline. Any data computations
 *                       that are shared between contexts should be performed
 *                       here, eventually producing renderable polydata.
 * syncContextState: Called from the vvApplication::display() prior to rendering.
 *                   This is where data should be transferred from the
 *                   application-side data pipeline into the context-side
 *                   rendering pipeline. At minimum, this will typically mean
 *                   taking the output polydata from the data pipeline and
 *                   connecting it to a mapper.
 *
 * At all stages, only the minimum work should be done; the data pipeline
 * should only re-execute when inputs changes, and the rendering pipeline
 * should only be updated when the application data changes.
